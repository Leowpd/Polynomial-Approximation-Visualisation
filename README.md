# Taylor-Series-Visualisation
Author: Leo Duncan.

Visually shows how Taylor Series can approximate functions.

The author uses MATLAB to develop a greater understanding of the matrial taught in MATHS 250 Algebra and Calculus 2 at UoA.

The user can specify the function to approximate,
the highest degree Taylor polynomial to generate,
the point the approximation generates around,
among some other inputs.

A loop generates the 1st, 2nd, ... , nth Taylor Polynomial, with a short pause in between each.
Each polynomial generated is shown on two graphs.
The first graph shows only the highest degree Taylor Polynomial so far,
and the other shows all Taylor Polynomials generated so far.

This shows the user how higher degree Taylor Polynomials give better approximations of the original function.
The second graph with all the overlaid polynomials also looks quite pretty.

Two examples are shwon below:
